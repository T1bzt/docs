It is difficult to take the first step when you look, how big the task is.
But remember, you don’t try to build a wall.
You don’t say "Im gonna build the biggest, baddest, greatest wall thats 
ever been built" You dont start there. You say, Im gonna lay this brick 
as perfetly as brick can be laid. There will not be one brick on the face of the earth 
thas going to be laid better than this brick, that im gonna lay in these next ten minutes.
And you do that every single day, and soon you have a wall
